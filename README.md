Jetset was an innovative web application that allows site visitors to search for flights based on the limites of their budget.

EX. I am in New York, I have $500, show me all the flights leaving on (day/month)

This project involved multiple API calls as well as handling a minor CORS issue.  Unfortunetly the API is now deprecated but the code is available if you want to take a peek.
