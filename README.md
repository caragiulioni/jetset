If you are a recruiter and would like a functioning version of Jetset to review, please contact me info@blockctrl.com.

Jetset is an innovative web application that allows site visitors to search for flights based on the limites of their budget.

EX. I am in New York, I have $500, show me all the flights leaving on (day/month)

This project involved multiple API calls as well as handling a minor CORS issue.  I had assitance completing this project from my teacher TRUDY MACNABB. If you are interested in speaking with Trudy about how we worked together to complete Jetset, please contact me info@blockctrl.com.
