				<h2>About</h2>
				<p>At JetSet, we believe in providing travelers with up to date, affordable flight information departing from and arriving to cities around the world.  We reject the notion that travel is a non affordable privilege - We want you to see the world and we want to help you get there.</p>
			</div>	

			<div class="aboutlast">
				<p>By allowing you to search based on your own budgetary needs and using an open date format, our aim is to not only offer economical flight options but also inspire the exploration of cities and regions our travelers may not have even considered before. </p>
			</div>


			<div>
				<h2>How it works</h2>
				<h3>Select your region and departure city</h3>
				<p>	Choose from where you are presently or somewhere you may be in the near future. We search all the surrounding airports in the area to make sure you don't miss out on a great fare.
				</p>
			</div>

			
			<h3>choose your maximum price</h3>
			<p>	Let's face it, whether you are travelling on a budget or have money to burn, we all love a good deal.  We use the currency of your origin city as the basis for your budget ex. if the origin is NYC, and the max price is 400, this means 400 USD. If the origin is Paris, and the max price is 400, this means 400 EURO.
			</p>
		

			<h3>when are you leaving?</h3>
			<p>	Have a few days off?  Plan a quick get away last minute.  you can also these field blank and keep your options open.
			</p>
		
			<h3>Connect or direct, The choice is yours.</h3>
			<p>	Flights with connections typically mean better priced fares but if you dont want to connect, that's fine too. Just check the box and you're good to go.
			</p>

			<h3>That's it!</h3>
			<p>JetSet will populate a list of up to date results for suggested trips within your budget range for you to choose from.
			</p>

			<div class="things"><h2>Things to know</h2>
			<p>Our data is cached once per hour and we do our best to provide information that is accurate and up to date. That being said, we do ask you keep in mind that flight rates are known to fluctuate regularly and without warning. So, if you find a great deal today, our advice to you is to to jump on it as soon as possible.</p></div>

			<p>Always remember you need a valid passport for airline travel and some destinations may require a travel visa. Be sure to check the stipulations set by your destination country before booking your flight. Be a good citizen and respect local people, culture and social customs.
